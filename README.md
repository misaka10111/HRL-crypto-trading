# Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Crypto Assets Mid-Frequency Trading

This project implements a hierarchical RL approach to manage a portfolio of crypto assets, decomposing the complex trading problem into:

- High-level policy: Strategic asset allocation and portfolio rebalancing
- Low-level policies: Execution of trades and market timing for individual assets
